## Definition

A prime number is a number that is only divisible by itself and one, example:  (2, 3, 5, 7, 11...). Further, for any given number, we can generate its prime factors by reducing it down to exclusively prime numbers that, when multiplied, equal the number in question.

## Process

1. Is the number divisible by 2.
2. If true then divide by 2.
3. If false, increase candidate and try again.
4. Repeat.
